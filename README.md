# Bit show react redux

Bit-show project from belgrade instite of technology done using react and react redux

For bootstraping i will use my https://github.com/Ladly/async-react-redux-with-routing boilerplate 

Use:

- yarn/npm install
- yarn/npm run dev

Idea: started as bit-show project to learn react-redux. It was too much fun to stop, so I combinded all http://www.bgit.rs/en/ projects

Also i wanted to create something bit larger to test scalability

Now since I achieved all wanted functionality it is time to fix many minor bugs and few issues (list is in trello). 

I also need to redesign whole app because this is more well just add bunch of pages and features without too much sense

The idea of styling each component separately is great until you need to change something so that will be changed too

Note: this is not suitable for deploy. Even though production mode is setted in webpack it is not minified and optimised for production
